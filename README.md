# Inventory

I created this app to gain an understanding of the basics of Express and MongoDB. Users can create, read, update and delete items. The styling was based off the pipboy from the Fallout games. I didn't spend too much time on the front end side as I plan to move towards making RESTful apps, and I plan to remake the frontend of this app using React as a future learning exercise.
