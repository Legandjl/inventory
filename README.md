Overview:

I created this app to gain an understanding of the basics of Express and MongoDB, and to practice development using the MVC development pattern. 

Users can create, read, update and delete items. Destructive operations are password protected. The styling is based on the PipBoy from the Fallout videogame series. I didn't spend too much time on the front end side as I plan to move towards making RESTful apps, and I intend to remake the frontend of this app using React as a future learning exercise. 

Technologies used:

Ejs,
Express,
Mongoose,
Node JS

What I learnt from this project:

I enjoyed using the MVC pattern, and found it to be an intuitive way to structure applications. I learnt how schemas and models fit together, and how to set up and query a database using mongoose. I feel much more confident now in terms of understanding how the front and backend fit together.
